Finally when Alice is being proposed to, with everyone watching, she again saw the rabbit in the corner of her eye.

After chasing the rabbit for a seemingly long time, Alice found herself standing inches away from a huge rabbit hole at the base of a tree.
As she tried to get a glimpse of anything in this rabbit hole, Alice fell into it for seemingly minutes, seeing many out of place objects on the way.
Finally Alice hit solid ground, in a strange room...
